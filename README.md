# cool-bank ðŸ˜Ž

Welcome to **cool-bank**, the most secure, most reliable, and most... *demonstrational* banking API on the web. We handle your fake money with the utmost seriousness. Please, don't try to deposit your real-life savings here. Our digital vaults are... well, they're a SQLite file.

-----

## Features that are cooler than the other side of the pillow

  * **User Accounts & Operations:** Create users, manage accounts, and perform top-secret financial operations. Who needs a physical branch when you have our API?

  * **"Enterprise-Grade" Database:** Powered by the unstoppable force of **SQLite3**. It's lightweight, it's fast, and it's definitely what all the big banks use. (Don't fact-check that).

  * **Fort Knox Security:** We use **JWT with RSA authentication**. Your session is signed with a private key and verified with a public one. It's so secure, even we have trouble remembering where we put the private key.

## Getting Started

Want to run your very own cool-bank? It's easy\! Just clone the repo and run this magic command from the root directory:

```sh
go run cmd/main.go -s
```

And voilÃ \! You're now the proud owner of a financial institution. Please use your power responsibly.

## Where the Magic Happens

  * The server starts its journey in `cmd/main.go`.
  * All the super-secret banking logic is tucked away inside the `internal/` directory. No peeking\! ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸš¨ A Serious (but still funny) Warning ðŸš¨

This is a portfolio project. A demonstration. A flight of fancy. **DO NOT** use this for actual banking. We are not liable if your cat's toy mouse savings account gets wiped out.
